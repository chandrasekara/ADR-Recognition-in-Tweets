This project was completed as part of the coursework for COMP90049 Knowledge Technologies at The University of Melbourne, Australia. The aim was to apply supervised learning techniques to determine whether an adverse drug reaction (ADR)  was present in individual tweets.

The bulk of analysis occurs in the supervised_learners.py, with the other files containing the various helper utility functions, as well as the datasets used for the analysis.

The project makes use of many components from Scikit-Learn, an open source machine learning library for Python.
