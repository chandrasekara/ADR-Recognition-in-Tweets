This project was completed as part of the coursework for COMP90049 Knowledge Technologies at The University of Melbourne, Australia. The aim was to apply supervised learning techniques to determine whether an adverse drug reaction (ADR)  was present in individual tweets.

The project makes use of many components from Scikit-Learn, an open source machine learning library for Python.
